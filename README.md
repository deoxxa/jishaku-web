Jishaku Web
===========

Jishaku Toshokan's web component!

Overview
--------

This is the code that runs [jishaku.net](http://www.jishaku.net/). It's written
in [go](http://golang.org/) and should run just about anywhere. It's designed to
be usable both as a public system, where many users are being served by one
instance, and as a private system, where only a small group or a single user is
using it.

Prerequisites
-------------

Right now, an instance of [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) is
required to store all the record information. This will change in the future.

Binaries
--------

Prebuilt binaries will be available soon, but for now you'll have to build the
application. This will require some knowledge of the go build process.

Building
--------

Instructions pending.
